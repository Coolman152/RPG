Logger v0.0.1

Re-implemented Mining cleanly:
- Buy a ⛏️ Bronze Pickaxe from Tool Trader
- Mine rocks (Copper/Tin/Iron) near the village outskirts
- Ores stack in inventory/bank
- Rocks deplete -> stub -> respawn
- Mining XP + popup

Controls:
- Tap/click to move
- E to interact
- Zoom: + / − buttons, wheel (if supported), or + / - keys


Camera refinement:
- Follow camera now uses a deadzone + smoothing to prevent jitter.
- Press C to toggle camera mode (Follow/Free). In Free mode, use WASD/arrow keys to pan.
- On iPad/touch: two-finger drag pans the camera (enters Free mode).
