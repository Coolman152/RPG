Isometric 3D RPG — Village v8

Fixes + improvements:
- NPC UI is now a fullscreen overlay with a clear ✕ close button.
  • You can close it by tapping ✕, pressing Esc, or tapping outside the modal card.
- Interior doors are now obvious:
  • The exit door inside buildings has a visible door model with an “EXIT” sign.
  • A glowing ring marker is placed on the exit door tile.

Everything else from v7 remains:
- Tool Trader shop (axe/rod)
- Banker in spawn inn with bank storage
- Log buyer / fish buyer
- Fishing spots

Controls:
- Tap/click to move
- Tap NPC/door/tree/fishing spot
- E to interact
- R to reset save (v8 has a new save key, so it won’t conflict with v7)
